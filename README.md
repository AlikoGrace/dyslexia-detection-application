# Dyslexia Detection Application

This project aims to detect the risk of dyslexia in children using interactive tests and machine learning models.

## Overview

The Dyslexia Detection Application consists of a backend server and a frontend mobile application. The backend handles user authentication, child registration, test administration, and integration with machine learning models. The frontend provides parents with a user-friendly interface to register their children, administer tests, and receive results.

## Backend

The backend server is responsible for managing user authentication, child registration, test administration, integration with machine learning models, and email notifications.

## Frontend

The frontend mobile application provides parents with a user-friendly interface to interact with the Dyslexia Detection Application. Parents can register their children, administer tests, and receive results.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the backend repository and the frontend repository.
2. Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend.
3. Configure environment variables for the backend (e.g., database connection URI, JWT secret key).
4. Run the backend server and the frontend application.

## Technologies Used
